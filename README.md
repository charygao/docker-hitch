# The official Hitch Docker image [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/varnish/docker-hitch.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/varnish/docker-hitch)
[Hitch](https://hitch-tls.org/) is a TLS proxy that is maintained by the Varnish community. It is specifically built to terminate TLS connections at high scale and forwards unencrypted HTTP traffic to Varnish or any other HTTP backend.

## Running

Running a Hitch Docker container can be done by using the following command:

```
docker run --name=hitch -p 443:443 varnish/hitch:latest
```

This container will expose port `443`, which is required for HTTPS traffic. 
## Connecting to Varnish

By default Hitch will connect to Varnish on `localhost` port `8843` with *PROXY protocol* support enabled. The hostname and port of Varnish can be changed through the `BACKEND_HOST` and `BACKEND_PORT` environment variables.

Here's an example where Hitch connects to a Varnish container with the hostname `varnish` on port `8080`:

```
docker run --name=hitch -p 443:443 --env BACKEND_HOST=varnish --env BACKEND_PORT=8080 varnish/hitch:latest
```

By default version 2 of the *PROXY protocol* is enabled. If you want to connect to Varnish over an *unencrypted HTTP connection*, please assign an empty string to the `PROXY_PROTOCOL_V2` environment variable as illustrated below:

```
docker run --name=hitch -p 443:443 --env PROXY_PROTOCOL_V2= varnish/hitch:latest
```

## Setting the certificate

The Hitch Docker image comes with a dummy certificate that is stored in `/etc/hitch/certs/example.com`. Using a bind mount, you can override the value of the certificate and use your own certificate.

Here's an example:

```
docker run --name=hitch -p 443:443 -v /path/to/your/certificate:/etc/hitch/certs/example.com varnish/hitch:latest
```

## Overriding the frontend connection settings

As previously mentioned, the Hitch container will run on port `443` and will be bound to all available network interfaces.

If you want to change this behavior, you can leverage the `FRONTEND_HOST` and `FRONTEND_PORT` environment variables. 

Here's an example where Hitch listens for incoming connections on port `8443`:

```
docker run --name=hitch -p 8443:8443 --env FRONTEND_PORT=8443 varnish/hitch:latest
```

## Overriding other settings

The Hitch configuration mostly relies on default values. 

The *frontend connection*, *backend connection*, and *proxy v2* settings are configured through environment variables.

The *certificate location* and the *runtime user* are set in the `/etc/hitch/hitch.conf` configuration file.


Any other [configuration parameter](https://github.com/varnish/hitch/blob/1.5.0/hitch.conf.man.rst) can also be set in the `hitch.conf` configuration file. You can override the contents of this file using a bind mount as illustrated below:

```
docker run --name=hitch -p 443:443 -v /path/to/your/hitch.conf:/etc/hitch/hitch.conf varnish/hitch:latest
```
